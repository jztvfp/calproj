# Turbine Ingestion Project

I have tried to build a few features into this project including:

## Features
1. DLT Pipelines using a multi-hop standard architecture
2. Auto Loader source
3. Streaming DLT
4. Expectations
5. Unit Testing
6. Asset bundles

## Other features  (thought of not implemented or not time to get working)

1. Source file checker (Turbines present or not)
2. Source file 
3. Referencing modules from Repo folders (couldn't get to work)
4. An efficient set up
5. Not convinced by the Presentation solution
