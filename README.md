# Turbine Ingestion Project

I have tried to build a few features into this project including:

## Features
1. DLT Pipelines using a multi-hop standard architecture
2. Auto Loader source
3. Streaming DLT
4. Expectations
5. Unit Testing
6. Asset bundles
7. A set up capability

## Other features  (thought of not implemented or not time to get working)

1. Source file checker (Turbines present or not)
2. Source file schema checker
3. Referencing modules from Repo folders (couldn't get to work on my machine)
4. An efficient set up
5. I'm not convinced by the Presentation solution but it is a start
6. Pytest testing of PySpark modules

## Observations

1. The VS Code extension is good for DAB development but not for DLT
2. The DLT development experience is still too painful even in the UI
3. The result is a slightly uncomfortable developer flow using both tools
4. DLT is still cool though.
5. Many of the Databricks offerings are still too buggy especially for inexperienced PySpark developers (and rusty ones like me)
